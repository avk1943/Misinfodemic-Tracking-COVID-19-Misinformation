Goodman, an economics correspondent for The Times, says there’s a key difference between that economic turmoil and today’s: the utter unpredictability of the outbreak’s spread. “The disaster feels eerily familiar, with trillions of dollars in wealth annihilated near-daily and deepening fears that businesses will fail,” he writes. “Yet the traditional policy prescriptions seem no match for the affliction at hand.”\n",

Goodman, an economics correspondent for The Times, says there’s a key difference between that economic turmoil and today’s: the utter unpredictability of the outbreak’s spread. “The disaster feels eerily familiar, with trillions of dollars in wealth annihilated near-daily and deepening fears that businesses will fail,” he writes. “Yet the traditional policy prescriptions seem no match for the affliction at hand.”\\nThe very means of controlling the health crisis — keeping workers home, limiting travel and disrupting commerce — risk making the economic crisis worse.\\n“A sense of powerlessness is feeding the fear that is prompting investors to dump anything risky, which is in turn damaging economic prospects and reinforcing fear — a feedback loop,” he writes.\\nBut even the 2008 crisis pales in comparison to the scale of the destruction wrought by the coronavirus.

People will die. @NewYorker | As COVID-19 has spread around the world, governments have taken extraordinary measures to control the spread of the disease, both within countries and across borders. They’ve required the closing of nonessential businesses, required populations to shelter at home, and restricted travel. The World Health Organization has been working with governments to track the spread of the disease and advise health authorities.\\n\\nAs countries and communities respond to the virus by closing schools and places of work and imposing quarantines, along with people limiting public interaction, children and the very poor are being greatly impacted. Loss of work for people who survive on minimal earnings is having a devastating impact on household incomes where people survive from day to day. The price of food and goods will likely rise as shortages emerge and people begin to hoard supplies. Unable to stock up, the poorest will be hard pressed to provide enough food for their children.'\n",

How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient. Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:  The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications. The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough. The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart.  Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.  Last updated March 23, 2020     | Source:                  CDClinks to external site  '\n",
